## Claude Desktop Configuration

### Basic Configuration (Documentation Tools Only)

For basic functionality that includes documentation and workflow creation tools, add this configuration to your Claude Desktop settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["n8n-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "stdio",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "error",
        "DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration (Full n8n Management)

For complete n8n instance management including workflow deployment and execution monitoring, use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["n8n-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "stdio",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "error",
        "DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT": "true",
        "N8N_API_URL": "http://localhost:5678/api/v1",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Note**: For local n8n instances, use `http://localhost:5678/api/v1` as the N8N_API_URL. Note that it's **HTTP** (not HTTPS) for local development, and includes the `/api/v1` path suffix.

### Configuration Steps

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings → MCP Servers
3. Add the configuration JSON above
4. Replace `your-n8n-instance.com` with your actual n8n instance URL
5. Replace `your-api-key` with your n8n API key
6. Restart Claude Desktop
